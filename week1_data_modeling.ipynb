    "- null values allowed\n",
    "- uniqueness constraints, on individual columns across columns\n",
    "- other column value constraints, on individual columns and across columns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types\n",
    "Columns within the dataframe can be expressed as the following in `SQL`\n",
    "- `Site`: TEXT\n",
    "- `Year`: INTEGER\n",
    "- `Date`: DATE\n",
    "- `Plot`: TEXT\n",
    "- `Location`: TEXT\n",
    "- `Snow_cover`: REAL\n",
    "- `Water_cover`: REAL\n",
    "- `Land_cover`: REAL\n",
    "- `Total_cover`: REAL\n",
    "- `Observer`: TEXT\n",
    "- `Notes`: TEXT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Key\n",
    "From the dataframe, it looks like we don't have one column that represents the primary key. It is more than likely composed of multiple columns. \n",
    "There are four columns that are likely to be part of the primary key: `Site`, `Date`, `Plot`, and `Location`. These columns together represent a unique observation of snow survey data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foreign Key(s)\n",
    "There are most likely a multitude of foreign keys. These foreign keys include `Site`, `Plot`, `Location`, and `Observer`. All four of these columns could have another table that gives more information about them. For example, `Site` could have information such as Continent, County, Coordinates, Average Temperature, etc. Likewise, all four columns could potentially have more information about them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Null Values\n",
    "Yes, null values are allowed. One of the columns that partically has a lot of them is `Notes`. Most of the observations don't have notes within them, meaning they will contain Null values. This is okay as they are not necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Uniqueness Constraints\n",
    "I don't think any columns have uniqueness in there values. From the `head` of our data, it suggests that each column has repetitive values. For example, we can see that `Site` is repeated all three times when viewing the `head` of the dataframe. Location has three different outputs for the three observations, however, it may be safe to say that they will be repeated as this is time series data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Constraints\n",
    "Another constraint that can be viewed in a relational database is value constraints. This means that the output value has to be confined between a specific range. In our data here, we see this in the `cover` columns. This is because these represent percentage cover, meaning that they are values from 0 - 100%. \n"
